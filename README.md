# 📧 Spam Mail Classifier Deployment

This project is a **Spam Mail Classifier Web App** built using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.  
It predicts whether a given email message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

The model is trained using **TF-IDF Vectorization** on a labeled dataset and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit Web Application**.

## 📝 Project Overview
- Developed a Spam Classifier using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Logistic Regression**.
- Processed a dataset containing labeled emails (Spam & Ham).
- Transformed text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- Trained a model to classify messages accurately.
- Saved the trained **model** and **vectorizer** using Pickle for deployment.
- Built a user-friendly **Streamlit Web App** to predict Spam in real-time.
